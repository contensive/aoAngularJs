Dependencies
This repository contains a set of native AngularJS directives based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS. As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:

AngularJS (requires AngularJS 1.4.x or higher, tested with 1.6.1). 0.14.3 is the last version of this library that supports AngularJS 1.3.x and 0.12.0 is the last version that supports AngularJS 1.2.x.
Angular-animate (the version should match with your angular's, tested with 1.6.1) if you plan in using animations, you need to load angular-animate as well.
Angular-touch (the version should match with your angular's, tested with 1.6.1) if you plan in using swipe actions, you need to load angular-touch as well.
Bootstrap CSS (tested with version 3.3.7). This version of the library (2.5.0) works only with Bootstrap CSS in version 3.x. 0.8.0 is the last version of this library that supports Bootstrap CSS in version 2.3.x.
